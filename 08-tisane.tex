If you are copying and pasting material from one of your papers, then remember to:
\begin{itemize}
    % \item Remove the abstract and instead add a little overview of the chapter and how it ties in to the rest of the thesis. You should also mention the original paper's source like: ``This chapter includes materials originally published in $\backslash$citet\{myownppr\}''
    % \item Make sure the formatting still works -- this is single column now!
    \item Consider rephrasing conference-paper-style language:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Find every place you mention some variation of ``in this paper'' and say ``in this chapter'' instead.
        \item Remove or rephrase the parts where you talk about ``our main contributions''.
        \item Rephrase the language describing code and data releases.
    \end{itemize}
    % \item Replace the conclusion section with a summary section. Again, you should tie this chapter back to the main themes of the thesis.
\end{itemize}

Our theory of hypothesis formalization describes how authoring analyses to
answer research questions requires analysts to jointly reason about their
conceptual domain knowledge, statistical methods, and analysis implementations
in code. For instance, scientists carefully consider which covariates to include
in statistical models based on their prior knowledge of confounding. However,
analysts' conceptual knowledge is often kept implicit. Analysts gravitate
towards statistical specifications they are familiar with, even if the analyses
are sub-optimal or do not assess their hypotheses, as we saw in the previous
chapter. Finally, ease of implementation further constrains the statistical
models that analysts try and use. These issues are especially salient for domain
experts who lack deep statistical or programming expertise (e.g., many
researchers).

Existing statistical software exacerbate these issues because they do not allow
analysts to externalize their implicit conceptual knowledge, receive guidance on
analysis approaches, and help authoring low-level statistical modeling
code~\autoref{sec:toolsAnalysis}. Our work on Tisane hypothesizes that in order
to address these issues, software tools should capture analysts' implicit
conceptual models and use them to derive statistical models. 

\textit{Conceptual models}~\footnote{Richard McElreath calls these implict
assumptions \textit{process models}~\cite{mcelreath2020statistical}. We use the
term \textit{conceptual models} in order to contrast from statistical models.}
are often-informal representations of variable relationships (e.g., list of
variable relationships, process diagrams, graphs), describing the underlying
data generating process. Conceptual models are difficult to reason about during
statistical analysis. Their implications on statistical modeling are not
obvious, especially to statistical non-experts. For example, the impact of
conceptual assumptions may only become apparent after fitting multiple
statistical models, if at all. Without explicitly grappling with conceptual
models prior to authoring statistical models, analysts run the risk of
introducing inconsistencies between their domain knowledge and statistical
models, which can lead to unintentionally answering a different research
question and asserting a conceptual model based on preferred results (i.e.,
HARKing~\cite{}). 

To facilitate more accurate hypothesis formalization and ultimately improve
validity during data analysis, we asked, \textbf{How might we derive (initial)
statistical models from conceptual models?}. Inferring a statistical model
raises two technical challenges: (1) How do we elicit the information necessary
for inferring a statistical model? and (2) How do we infer a statistical model,
given this information? We explore and address these issues by iteratively
designing, developing, and evaluating \textbf{Tisane, a system for implementing
generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized linear mixed-effects models
(GLMMs) from explicit statements of implicit conceptual assumptions}. 


The first implementation of Tisane (\autoref{sec:tisane}) was as an open-source
Python package available on \texttt{pip}~\cite{tisaneOnPip}. Case studies and
real-world use of Tisane~\cite{} demonstrated not only the viability but also
the desirability of tool support for authoring statistical models from
conceptual models. Therefore, we explored how to further improve Tisane's
programming and interaction models to better suit novice analysts
(\autoref{sec:exploratoryStudy}) and released a second version in R, which we
call \rTisane~\cite{rTisane link}. The R implementation allowed us to more
direclty compare \rTisane to a scaffolded workflow using widely used linear
modeling libraries, including the \texttt{lme4}, in R. 

Tisane provides a \textbf{\SDSLlong} for expressing % conceptual and data
relationships between variables. For example, a public health researcher can
express that average county income is associated with hospital spending based on
health economics theory or specify that hospitals exist within counties.
%By making conceptual and data measurement knowledge explicit in programs, Tisane protects analysts against specifying statistical models that are inconsistent with domain knowledge and may prompt analysts to reflect on their domain assumptions. % requires analysts to externalize their  domain assumptions, , and avoids statistical model drift from
Tisane compiles the explicitly stated relationships into an internal
\textbf{graph representation} and then traverses the graph to infer candidate
GLMs/GLMMs based on the modified disjunctive
criteria~\cite{vanderweele2019modifiedDisjunctiveCriterion} (designed for
scenarios where analysts are uncertain about the causal relationships in their
domain). Analysts can then query Tisane for a statistical model that explains a
specific dependent variable from a set of independent variables. Based on the
input query, Tisane asks analysts disambiguating questions to output a script
for fitting a valid GLM/GLMM. We call this end-to-end process \textbf{interactive
compilation}. Interactive compilation enables analysts to focus
on their primary variables of interest as the system checks that analysts do not
overlook relevant variables, such as potential confounders or data clustering
that could compromise generalizability (\higherLevel, \connectConceptualStats). 
% The system also guides analysts to examine their
% data distributions, which may challenge and prompt reconsideration of analysts'
% assumptions about a dataset.

\section{Why is Tisane necessary, isn't Tea enough?}
Many research questions analysts want to answer require more complex analyses.

\section{Limitations and Motivation for Re-design}
Despite the importance of conceptual modeling to statistical analysis, it is
unknown what challenges statistical novices face when expressing their domain
knowledge. To identify what statistical non-experts want and are capable of
expressing about their conceptual models, we conducted a formative study using
\tisane~\cite{jun2022tisane}, an open-source tool designed to bridge this gap.
We found important limitations to \tisane. Surprisingly, we found that some
keywords and functions in \tisane were at too high a level of abstraction.
Analysts wanted to express their conceptual relationships with greater detail
and specificity. Analysts also wanted to express ambiguity about the a
relationship's direction in the conceptual model.
