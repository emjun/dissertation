If you are copying and pasting material from one of your papers, then remember to:
\begin{itemize}
    % \item Remove the abstract and instead add a little overview of the chapter and how it ties in to the rest of the thesis. You should also mention the original paper's source like: ``This chapter includes materials originally published in $\backslash$citet\{myownppr\}''
    % \item Make sure the formatting still works -- this is single column now!
    \item Consider rephrasing conference-paper-style language:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Find every place you mention some variation of ``in this paper'' and say ``in this chapter'' instead.
        \item Remove or rephrase the parts where you talk about ``our main contributions''.
        \item Rephrase the language describing code and data releases.
    \end{itemize}
    % \item Replace the conclusion section with a summary section. Again, you should tie this chapter back to the main themes of the thesis.
\end{itemize}

We found in~\autoref{sec:toolsAnalysis} that there is a mismatch between the
interfaces existing statistical tools provide and the needs of analysts,
especially those who have domain knowledge but lack deep statistical expertise
(e.g., many researchers). To author analyses that formalize their research
questions and hypotheses, analysts need to jointly reason their domain, study
design, statistical methods, and computational tools. However, current tools
separate these concerns, and statistical computing tools focus on allowing but
not scaffolding access to statistical methods. To facilitate more accurate
hypothesis formalization and thereby reduce threats to validity and improve
analytical practices, we asked \textbf{how might we derive (initial) statistical
models from knowledge about concepts and data collection?}. Inferring a statistical model raises two
technical challenges: (1) How do we elicit the information necessary for
inferring a statistical model? and (2) How do we infer a statistical model,
given this information? We address these issues in \textbf{Tisane, a system for integrating
conceptual relationships, data collection details, and modeling choices when
specifying generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized linear mixed-effects
models (GLMMs)}. 

Tisane provides a \textbf{\SDSLlong} for expressing % conceptual and data
relationships between variables. For example, a public health researcher can
express that average county income is associated with hospital spending based on
health economics theory or specify that hospitals exist within counties.
%By making conceptual and data measurement knowledge explicit in programs, Tisane protects analysts against specifying statistical models that are inconsistent with domain knowledge and may prompt analysts to reflect on their domain assumptions. % requires analysts to externalize their  domain assumptions, , and avoids statistical model drift from
Tisane compiles the explicitly stated relationships into an internal
\textbf{graph representation} and then traverses the graph to infer candidate
GLMs/GLMMs based on the modified disjunctive
criteria~\cite{vanderweele2019modifiedDisjunctiveCriterion} (designed for
scenarios where analysts are uncertain about the causal relationships in their
domain). Analysts can then query Tisane for a statistical model that explains a
specific dependent variable from a set of independent variables. Based on the
input query, Tisane asks analysts disambiguating questions to output a script
for fitting a valid GLM/GLMM. We call this end-to-end process \textbf{interactive
compilation}. Interactive compilation enables analysts to focus
on their primary variables of interest as the system checks that analysts do not
overlook relevant variables, such as potential confounders or data clustering
that could compromise generalizability (\higherLevel, \connectConceptualStats). 
% The system also guides analysts to examine their
% data distributions, which may challenge and prompt reconsideration of analysts'
% assumptions about a dataset. 
% Figure~\ref{fig:figureSystemOverview} provides an overview
% of this process.
