% \polish{Break up into Tisane and rTisane chapters?}

Authoring statistical models requires analysts to jointly reason about their
conceptual domain knowledge, statistical methods, and analysis implementations
in code, as our theory of hypothesis formalization describes. For instance,
scientists carefully consider which covariates to include in statistical models
based on their prior knowledge of confounding. However, analysts' conceptual
knowledge is often kept implicit. Analysts gravitate towards statistical
specifications they are familiar with, even if the analyses are sub-optimal or
do not assess their hypotheses, as we saw in the previous chapter. Finally, ease
of implementation further constrains the statistical models that analysts try
and use. These issues are especially salient for domain experts who lack deep
statistical or programming expertise (e.g., many researchers).

Existing statistical software exacerbates these issues because it does not allow
analysts to externalize their implicit conceptual knowledge, receive guidance on
analysis approaches, or obtain assistance with authoring low-level statistical modeling
code~\autoref{sec:toolsAnalysis}. Our work on Tisane and \rTisane hypothesizes that in order
to address these issues, software tools should capture analysts' implicit
conceptual models and use them to derive statistical models. 

\textit{Conceptual models}\footnote{Richard McElreath calls these implict
assumptions \textit{process models}~\cite{mcelreath2020statistical}. We use the
term \textit{conceptual models} to differentiate them from statistical models.}
are often informal representations of variable relationships (e.g., list of
variable relationships, process diagrams, graphs), describing the underlying
data generating process. Conceptual models are difficult to reason about during
statistical analysis. Their implications on statistical modeling are not
obvious, especially to statistical non-experts. For example, the impact of
conceptual assumptions may only become apparent after fitting multiple
statistical models, if at all. Without explicitly grappling with conceptual
models prior to authoring statistical models, analysts run the risk of
introducing inconsistencies between their domain knowledge and statistical
models, which can lead to unintentionally answering a different research
question and asserting a conceptual model based on preferred results (i.e.,
HARKing~\cite{kerr1998harking}). 

To facilitate more accurate hypothesis formalization and analysis, we asked,
\textbf{How might we derive (initial) statistical models from conceptual
models?} Inferring a statistical model raises two technical challenges: (1) How
do we elicit the information necessary for inferring a statistical model? and
(2) How do we infer a statistical model, given this information? We explore and
address these issues by iteratively designing, developing, and evaluating
\textbf{Tisane, a system for implementing generalized linear models (GLMs) and
generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) from explicit statements of conceptual assumptions}. 

Tisane provides a \textbf{\SDSLlong} for expressing % conceptual and data
relationships between variables. Tisane compiles the explicitly stated
relationships into an internal \textbf{graph representation}. Tisane then
traverses the graph to infer candidate GLMs/GLMMs based on recommendations from
the graphical causal reasoning community. Analysts can then query Tisane for a
statistical model that explains a specific dependent variable from an
independent variable of interest. Tisane assists analysts in disambiguating
among multiple potential statistical models, ultimately producing a single,
final output script for fitting a valid GLM/GLMM.

Through this interactive process, Tisane focuses analysts on reflecting on and externalizing their
implicit conceptual assumptions and checks that analysts do not overlook
relevant variables, such as potential confounders or data clustering, that could
compromise generalizability of statistical results. %(\higherLevel, \connectConceptualStats).

We released Tisane as an open-source Python package
available on \texttt{pip} (see~\cite{tisaneWebsite}).
Case studies and
real-world usage of Tisane demonstrated not only the viability but also the
desirability of tool support for authoring statistical models from conceptual
models (\autoref{sec:tisane_case_studies}).

\section{Summary of Contributions}

% Reminder: Thesis statement
% Domain-specific languages that provide abstractions for expressing conceptual
% knowledge, data collection procedures, and analysis intents instead of specific
% statistical modeling decisions coupled with automated reasoning to compile
% conceptual specifications into statistical analysis code help statistical
% non-experts more readily author valid analyses. 

\tisane embodies the hypothesis central to this dissertation: A DSL for
expressing implicit conceptual knowledge and automated reasoning enable
statistical non-experts to author valid statistical models. In case studies of
\tisane, we found that the DSL (\thesisChallengeExplicit) makes analysts more aware of
their implicit domain knowledge. By deriving statistical models from
externalized conceptual models (\thesisChallengeRep), \tisane also fills in the
statistical knowledge and programming gaps analysts face when authoring
statistical analyses. \tisane demonstrates how these two approaches combined,
can improve statistical model authoring for statistical non-experts.

% connecting conceptual modeling to statistical modeling increases the statistical
% conclusion and external validity of analyses~\cite{shadish2010campbell}.  

% The conceptual model disambiguation process in \rTisane
% also facilitates reflection on implicit knowledge. 

% we refined what the programming and interaction model
% for expressing conceptual models and connecting them to statistical models
% should be. Most notably, the second release of \tisane, as \rTisane, provides
% more explicit support for conceptual model specification and disambiguation. 

% \tisane and \rTisane are in stark contrast to the current ecosystem of
% statistical analysis software designed to give analysts maximal mathematical and
% computational control at the cost of support for connecting conceptual and
% statistical models. 
% The pending lab study results will demonstrate the impact of
% \rTisane on (i) the conceptual models analysts specify and their reflection
% process, (ii) (output) statistical model quality, and (iii) awareness and
% learned insights analysts takeaway about their domain and data analysis process.

% The summative evaluation study concretizes the impact of \tisane. Analysts
% report being more reflective and systematic in their thinking about implicit
% conceptual assumptions due to \rTisanes DSL and conceptual model disambiguation
% process. The statistical models analysts produce also more accurately estimate
% the true relationships in the data, lower AIC/BIC and higher R-squared.
