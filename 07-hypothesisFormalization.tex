If you are copying and pasting material from one of your papers, then remember to:
\begin{itemize}
    % \item Remove the abstract and instead add a little overview of the chapter and how it ties in to the rest of the thesis. You should also mention the original paper's source like: ``This chapter includes materials originally published in $\backslash$citet\{myownppr\}''
    % \item Make sure the formatting still works -- this is single column now!
    \item Consider rephrasing conference-paper-style language:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Find every place you mention some variation of ``in this paper'' and say ``in this chapter'' instead.
        \item Remove or rephrase the parts where you talk about ``our main contributions''.
        \item Rephrase the language describing code and data releases.
    \end{itemize}
    % \item Replace the conclusion section with a summary section. Again, you should tie this chapter back to the main themes of the thesis.
\end{itemize}

Although prior work has observed \textit{that} data analysis is
iterative~\cite{liu2019paths,grolemund2014cognitive} and involves multiple
levels of considerations~\cite{liu2019understanding}, \textit{how} analysts move
between these cognitive, statistical, and computational realities iteratively
has remained under-scrutinized. To fill this gap, we conducted a content analysis of 50 published
empirical publications from diverse disciplines and a lab study with 24 data
scientists authoring analyses to identify the steps and challenges involved in
authoring analyses. 

Based on our content analysis and lab study findings, we coin and define
\textit{hypothesis formalization} as a dual-search process~\cite{klahr1988dual}
that involves developing and integrating cognitive representations from two
different perspectives---conceptual hypotheses and concrete model
implementations. Analysts move back and forth between these two perspectives
during formalization while balancing conceptual, data-driven, statistical, and
programming implementation constraints. Analysts iterate over conceptual steps
to refine their hypothesis in a \textit{hypothesis refinement loop}. Analysts
also iterate over computational and implementation steps in a \textit{model
implementation loop}. Data collection and data properties may also prompt
conceptual revisions and influence statistical model implementation.
