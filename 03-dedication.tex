To Bill Thompson: \\
Thank you for sharing your sharp intellect, patience, kindness, and love of mountains. \\
Thanks for modeling how to pursue important scientific endeavors and bring people along. \\ 
You're with me always as I design studies and interpret data, crack open a can of beer at the top of a mountain, and orienteer through the world and life. \\
Cheers to you, Bill.

% To all the wild women who have danced with me. I promise to never stop. 
To the wild women in my life \\
who got off the speeding train \\ 
to nowhere \\
and are dancing on the platform and \\
throughout the grove -- \\
you know who you are.
