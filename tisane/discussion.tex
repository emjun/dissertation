What was surprising was that START HERE....

Both design implications suggest the need to re-structure Tisane's programming
and interaction models. First, Tisane's specification language needs to be more
specific and low-level. This finding is \textit{counterintuitive} because a
well-documented strategy for making programming tasks easier for non-experts has
been to raise the level of abstraction for a programming
domain~\cite{chasins2018rousillon,satyanarayan2017vega}. Yet, we have evidence
that suggests the opposite for specifying a conceptual model and study design.
Second, Tisane's specification process could be more tiered, and disambiguation
could leverage ambiguity in analysts' specification as opportunities for more
numerous intelligent suggestions and guidance. 

\todo{Mention that the focus needs to be on conceptual level, but within conceptual level, there should be opportunity to move up and down the ladder of conceptual abstraction}
