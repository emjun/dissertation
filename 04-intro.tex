Statistical analysis plays a critical role in how people evaluate data and make
decisions. Policy makers rely on models to track disease, inform health
recommendations, and allocate resources. Scientists develop, evaluate, and
compare theories based on statistical results. Journalists report on new
findings in science, which individuals use to make decisions that impact their
nutrition, finances, and other aspects of their lives. Faulty statistical models can lead to spurious estimations of disease spread,
findings that do not generalize or reproduce, and a misinformed public. 
% As data science and statistical analysis has and continues to become more
% prevalent, the number of analysis authors who are not statistical experts will
% increase. 

Despite the prevalence of statistical analyses and their central importance to a
number of disciplines, they remain challenging to author accurately. The key
challenge in developing accurate statistical models lies not in a lack of access
to mathematical tools, of which there are many (e.g., R~\cite{team2013r},
Python~\cite{sanner1999python}, SPSS~\cite{spss}, and SAS~\cite{sas}), but in
accurately applying them in conjunction with domain theory, data collection,
statistical knowledge, and programming ability~\cite{mcelreath2020statistical}.
Analysts must translate their implicit domain knowledge into statistical models
that they can then implement and execute in code. However, this process---which
requires disciplinary, statistical, and programming expertise---is out of reach
for statistical non-experts who depend on accurate analyses, including many
researchers. 
% This process requires

\section{Thesis Approach and Statement}
This dissertation asks if separating the above concerns and incorporating
automated reasoning in statistical software could benefit statistical
non-experts. Towards this goal, I combine techniques from human-computer
interaction, programming languages/software engineering, and statistics to (i)
characterize the cognitive and operational steps to author statistical analyses
and (ii) develop novel interactive systems that enable statistical non-experts
to author valid analyses. As detailed below, I not only move between systems
building and empirical studies but use each to deepen and enhance the other.

The work described in the dissertation demonstrates the following:% thesis statement: 
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Thesis statement}
\paragraph{Thesis statement} \label{para:thesisStatement}
% Centered on the insight that domain experts using statistical methods are
% focused on their domain 

%%% COULD MAKE THIS STRONGER?
Domain-specific languages that provide abstractions for expressing conceptual
knowledge, data collection procedures, and analysis intents instead of specific
statistical modeling decisions coupled with automated reasoning to compile
conceptual specifications into statistical analysis code help statistical
non-experts more readily author valid analyses. 

Statistical non-experts can more readily author valid analyses using a
combination of domain-specific languages (DSL) and automated reasoning. Rather
than specify statistical modeling decisions directly, analysis DSLs can express
conceptual knowledge, data collection procedures, and analysis intents.
Automated reasoning methods can then compile conceptual DSL specifications into
statistical analysis code.

Three challenges fall out of this thesis statement: 

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Challenge 1}
\section*{Challenge 1: How to make implicit domain knowledge explicit.} %- domain knowledge
Designing abstractions focused on conceptual knowledge requires identifying what
domain knowledge analysts want and can express and balancing these constraints
with what automated reasoning approaches may require. What is easy to express
and what is easy to assume for the sake of automation may be at odds, especially
when analysts provide ambiguous specifications that could be compiled into
multiple statistical analyses. The challenge therefore, is to design language
constructs that are usable for analysts and useful for automated reasoning and
support interactive program specification as necessary.

% Finding: interactive disambiguation not just necessary for refinement and automated reasoning but *useful* to analysts for reflection

% Shifting focus onto the goal/motivation of analysis and less on the details that can overwhelm and restrict analysts

% **Not just higher levels of abstraction but appropriate abstractions that allow analysts to dig deeper into the appropriate parts

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Challenge 2}
\section*{Challenge 2: Represent and reason about key statistical analysis decisions} %- programming
A central idea in this thesis is that software systems should take on the
responsibility of translating conceptual knowledge into statistical analyses.
This is akin to a compilation process that requires representing the conceptual
knowledge analysts express and reasoning over it to derive statistical
analyses that respect statistical best practices and rules. A
major challenge is in picking representations so that the reasoning is straightforward. 
% not only straightforward but also beneficial in someway (expressivity, extensibility for both Tea and Tisane)

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Challenge 3}
\section*{Challenge 3: Increase analysts' statistical knowledge/understanding} %- statistics
% connect to Bellotti on user control?
While automating statistical analysis can be helpful, analysts relying on data
to make high-impact decisions (e.g., policy, scientific discovery) often need to
understand why an analysis approach is appropriate and what the implications of
the results are to their domain. Furthermore, software can inform how users
approach future analyses. Therefore, educating analysts about the applicability
and impact of statistical decisions and guiding their interpretation of results
are important.

\section{Summary of Contributions}
This dissertation contributes principles and systems for designing data analysis
tools for statistical non-experts. The contributions can be summarized as follows: 

\begin{comment}
new domain-specific languages (DSLs),
representations, and reasoning approaches for authoring statistical analyses. Additionally, 
a new theory describing the cognitive and operational steps involved in
authoring statistical analyses. In the process of designing the second DSL, we
also explored new methods for eliciting and integrating user feedback throughout
programming language design. The content of thesis is as follows. 

This dissertation contributes new domain-specific languages (DSLs) for authoring

feedback throughout programming language design. The content of thesis is as
follows. 

Specifically, I designed and implemented two systems, Tea~\cite{jun2019tea} and
Tisane~\cite{jun2022tisane}, that leverage \textbf{domain-specific languages}
(DSLs) to capture analysts' implicit assumptions and conceptual knowledge. Users
\textbf{interactively compile} these high-level specifications into low-level
code. To infer valid statistical analyses, the systems \textbf{programmatically
represent and reason about core statistical authoring challenges} as constraints
and graphs (\autoref{fig:tools}).
% As a result, my systems prevent common analysis
% mistakes~\cite{jun2019tea,jun2022tisane}.

\begin{enumerate} 
    \item An assessment of the existing state of data analysis practice and tool support.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Our theory of \hypoForm describes the cognitive and operational
        steps involved in translating a high-level conceptual research question
        and hypothesis into a statistical analysis implemented in code. This
        conceptual framework is useful for explaining what support existing
        statistical tools fail to provide statistical non-experts and justifying
        the design of systems developed in this dissertation.
        \item We provide the first account scrutinizing the \hypoForm process in
        situ. Whereas previous studies of data analysis have relied on
        self-reports about analyses, we conduct an in-depth lab study where we
        observe analysts prepare and even start to implement statistical
        analyses. 
        \item We qualitatively assess 20 statistical analysis libraries and
        standalone systems in order ot understand how they structure data
        analysis authoring. Combining our theory of \hypoForm and this tools
        assessment, we develop three design implications for how data analysis
        software could better serve statistical non-experts. 
    \end{enumerate}

    \item The design, implementation, and evaluation of new DSLs. These DSLs
    explore ways to design abstractions that prioritize making implicit domain
    knowledge explicit. 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The \tea DSL provides a high-level API so that analysts can make
        explicit their asumptions about the data and their hypotheses to test
        using Null Hypothesis Significance Tests. 
        \item The \tisane DSL captures analysts' ``fuzzy'' assumptions about how
        variables relate in their discipline in the form of a \textit{conceptual
        model}.
        \item A formative study showed how statistical non-experts implicitly
        think about causality, how they would like to express their implicit
        assumptions, and what they expect language constructs describing
        conceptual models to mean. These findings informed the re-design of
        \tisane's DSL, release as \rTisane.
        \item Case studies and a controlled lab study demonstrate the benefit of
        these DSLs in helping analysts become more aware of their implicit
        assumptions. 
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Formal representations and automated reasoning approaches for
    statistical analysis authoring. To support statistical testing and modeling,
    we develop representations that allow automated reasoning to compile
    conceptual models into statistical models. 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item In \tea, we implement a constraint-based model and knowledge base
        for Null Hypothesis Significance Tests. 
        \item In \tisane, we develop an intermediate graph representation to
        summarize key conceptual assumptions and data collection details.
        Importantly, a subgraph of the representation is a causal diagram useful
        for deriving statistical models formally. 
        \item Finally, we develop an interaction model for \textit{interactively
        compiling} high-level conceptual specifications into statistical models.
        % \polish{In a controlled lab study, we find that interactive compilation
        % contributes to analysts' increased awareness of their domain, data, and
        % statistics during data analysis.}
    \end{enumerate}
    % \item a \textbf{formal constraint-based model} to specify and select among
    % common Null Hypothesis Statistical Tests in Tea (see~\autoref{chapter:tea}); 
    % \item empirical findings of how authoring analyses requires integrating
    % conceptual, data, statistical, and programming expertise, which we summarize
    % in our \textbf{theory of hypothesis formalization} (see~\autoref{chapter:hypoForm}); 
    % \item an analysis of how the current statistical software ecosystem does not
    % explicitly support and may even hinder hypothesis formalization, suggesting
    % new \textbf{design opportunities and implications} (see~\autoref{chapter:hypoForm});
    % \item a \textbf{mixed-initiative approach} for ``interactively compiling''
    % linear models from conceptual and data relationships in Tisane; 
    % \item empirical \textbf{findings on researchers' implicit semantics of
    % conceptual models} (see~\autoref{chapter:tisane});
    % \item \textbf{new language constructs and interaction methods} for
    % reflecting on and refining conceptual models in a second version of Tisane,
    % which we call rTisane (see~\autoref{chapter:tisane}); and
    % \item qualitative and quantitative \textbf{results showing the benefit of
    % recording conceptual models and compiling them into statistical models} in
    % rTisane over a scaffolded workflow (see~\autoref{chapter:tisane}).
