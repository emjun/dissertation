{\color{orange} Insert introduction here.}

This chapter typically includes: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item a brief overview
    \item a background section
    \item a challenges section
    \item a section about your approach
    \item a section (or subsection in the approach section) giving a dissertation outline (a roadmap of the rest of the thesis)
\end{itemize}
Alternatively: you could choose to remove the background section and make a separate background chapter directly following this introduction chapter.
