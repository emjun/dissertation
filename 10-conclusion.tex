\section{Summary of contributions}
\section{Note on methodology and implications}
Overall: Integrate systems building with formative and summative evaluations and deeper dives into understanding end-users (hypothesis formalization)
- strength of this work is moving back and forth between and integrating empirical studies with systems building
- Even within empirical studies, explored and used many qualitative and quantitative approaches
- Within systems building: Use diversity of technologies
- Identify need for methodologies in the future for designing DSLs \textit{with} end-users

Reflecting back on design process: 
- Tea started with numerous personal experiences and informal observations of how computer scientists author statistical analyses
- Started DSL design with primitives we assumed would be approachable based on survey of introductory quant methods courses. 

What is the formalism end-users have to learn, where does it come from, how well does it align with what they want to do/say, etc.


\section{EUSE++}
\section{Where all this is going / Why do we care about any of this?}
- a reinterpretation of EUSE -- programming tools as bicycles of the mind

\section{Discussion: The role of programs and the act of programming as a reflective practice}
Finding: interactive disambiguation not just necessary for refinement and automated reasoning but *useful* to analysts for reflection

**Not just higher levels of abstraction but appropriate abstractions that allow analysts to dig deeper into the appropriate parts


\section{Re-orienting the task we are designing for}
Shifts the design problem on its head to view statistical analysis as a means to
the larger end of helping analysts understand their domain better.

Design for the purpose that statistical analysis serves. -- Norman quote?

\section{Future work}
Has this dissertation lost its way? Further re-orienting towards what users *really* want: to understand their domain
Push further in directions this work orients us 
- more support for understanding results, especially when some questions may not be answerable with the data/how it was collected
- knowing how robust the results are --> why not just multiverse everything?
**how do we resolve and come out from under the tyranny of false positive rates fear

\subsection{Connecting modeling with testing} 

\subsection{What about in the face of LLMs?}
