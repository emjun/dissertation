I am lucky to have many, many people to thank. 

\textit{I thank my advisors Jeffrey Heer and \reneJust.} Jeff, thank you for
your endless creativity, sense of humor, and focused attention in all our
conversations. I had a lot of fun and freedom during the second half of my PhD
thanks to you. \rene, thank you for your consistent insistence on the details
always.

% \item Committee 
\textit{I have the best committee, hands down.} Emery Berger, I am deeply grateful
that you agreed to meet with me, then a total stranger, at the start of your
sabbatical at MSR in 2018. Who knew that coffee would lead to many, many
more espressos while we worked on Tea and more. You have been my most ardent
champion and creative conversational partner. Thank you for including me in your latest crazy idea and laughing with me
through the highs and lows of graduate school. 
% Thank you for always keeping
% me updated on your latest crazy idea and bringing me into projects. Your
% support through the highs and lows of graduate school, always with a heavy
% bout of laughter, kept me going. 


% Emery, you may be the best mad scientist I know, but above all,
% you are the strongest advocate I could have asked for. 
Leilani Battle, thank you for your continual enthusiasm and support for my
research and mentorship since you were a postdoc at UW! It's great to have you back.    
Tyler McCormick, thank you for welcoming me into your research group and the
Center for Statistics and the Social Sciences (CSSS). My thinking and
scholarship have expanded due to our conversations and collaboration. 
% \item IDL, PLSE, Zach 

\textit{I feel lucky to have been part of the warm UW CSE community throughout
my PhD.} In particular, I am indebted to the members of the Interactive Data Lab
(IDL) with whom I overlapped during my PhD for their camraderie: Arvind
Satyanarayan, Ham Wongsuphasawat, Dominik Moritz, Yeaseul Kim, Younghoon Kim,
Jane Hoffswell, Sherry Wu, Alex Kale, Yang Liu, Matt Conlen, Zening Qu, Mick
Kittivorawong, Ameya Patil, Junran Yang, Madeleine Grunde-McLaughlin, Josh
Horowitz, and Luke Snyder. Michael Correll and Maureen Stone, while not students
in IDL, were consistent members of the lab. Thank you, all, for keeping me
humble, honest, and hopeful about the positive social impact of great research
and open-source software.

% In addition to IDL, 
I have also been fortunate to be part of the idiosyncratic PLSE
lab. 
% To my friends in PLSE over the years, of which there are too many to name
% individually, 
% Thank you for all the snacks, heated
% conversations, and tea. 
To my PLSE labmates over the years, of which there are too many to name
individually, I love how ferociously curious and whimsical you are about
everything in research and life. I would not have pursued this
research without PLSE welcoming me early on. In this regard, I want to give
special thanks to my friends Sarah Chasins, James Bornholt, Sami Davies, Chandra
Nandi, Amanda Swearngin, Chenglong Wang, Mangpo Phothilimthana, Pavel Panchekha,
and Max Willsey. Zachary Tatlock, thank you for investing so much of yourself
into making PLSE the best place to pursue daring research, have fun, and make
friends. 

To Elise Dorough, thank you for everything you do to keep CSE running while
still making time to help my peers and me through any situation (and many
emotions). To Joe Eckert, thank you for answering my numerous Slack messages
and cries for help even when I caused the logistical problems myself. To
Elle Brown, thank you for your kindness. To Lisa Merlin, thank you for
helping me with countless reimbursements and doing everything in your power
to make research smooth. 

% To my CSE 492 (?) officemates, especially James Bornholt and Callie Bee, thank
% you for sharing in many humorous memories. 
\textit{The larger UW ecosystem has also shaped my scholarship.} To the members
of CSSS, thank you for welcoming me and giving me many opportunities to learn
from and ask questions of scholars across the social and statistical sciences.
The interdisciplinary seminars and courses, such a Thomas Richardson's offering
of CSSS/STAT 566 on causal reasoning, were instrumental in my graduate
education. There are a few individual mentors to whom my gratitude is overdue:
Daniela Rosner (HCDE), Tim Althoff (CSE), and Amy Ko (iSchool). Thanks also to
the larger HCI community of DUB. 
% I have been incredibly lucky to have mentors across
% campus. To Daniela Rosner, whose encouragement and mentorship during my PhD
% is long overdue, thank you for sharing your curiosity, creativity, and
% humor. To Tim Althoff, thank you for our brainstorming sessions to explore
% research ideas. 

% \item MSR internship mentors: Mary, Daniel, Ben 
\textit{Throughout my PhD, I was also fortunate to expand my research horizons
through two summer internships at Microsoft Research with Mary Czerwinski,
Daniel McDuff, and Ben Zorn.} Thank you for entrusting me to run with new ideas,
modeling constructive mentorship styles, and becoming friends over the years.
