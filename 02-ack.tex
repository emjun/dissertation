    First and foremost, I thank my advisors Jeffrey
    Heer and Rene Just. Jeff, thank you for your endless creativity, sense of

    the second half of my PhD thanks to you and your generosity. Rene, thank you
    for your consistent insistence on thinking through all the details and
    getting them aligned and coherent before diving into something (which has been my tendency).

    with me, then a total stranger, at the start of your sabbatical in 2018;
    worked with me on Tea; never fail to keep me updated on and include me in on
    projects and the latest ideas you are excited about; and support me through
    the highs and lows of graduate school, usually with a lot of laughter. I
    leave every single conversation with you energized and excited to tackle a
    new problem and try out an unconventional approach. Emery, you may be the
    best mad scientist I know, but above all, you are the strongest advocate I
    could have asked for.

    alive. Patrice Staiger and Carrie DeMartini, thank you for guiding me to and
    through The Emily Program. Traig, Heunsoo, and the others I encountered at
