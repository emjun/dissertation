If you are copying and pasting material from one of your papers, then remember to:
\begin{itemize}
    % \item Remove the abstract and instead add a little overview of the chapter and how it ties in to the rest of the thesis. You should also mention the original paper's source like: ``This chapter includes materials originally published in $\backslash$citet\{myownppr\}''
    % \item Make sure the formatting still works -- this is single column now!
    \item Consider rephrasing conference-paper-style language:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Find every place you mention some variation of ``in this paper'' and say ``in this chapter'' instead.
        \item Remove or rephrase the parts where you talk about ``our main contributions''.
        \item Rephrase the language describing code and data releases.
    \end{itemize}
    % \item Replace the conclusion section with a summary section. Again, you should tie this chapter back to the main themes of the thesis.
\end{itemize}

The overall narrative I want to tell: 

Evolution of design approach: 

Getting to the user more directly Once we had the
idea, we wanted to see what would be actually not just usable but helpful. This
led us to engage with users in the lab

====

As we found in our analysis of tools (\autoref{sec:toolsAnalysis}), a wide
variety of tools (such as SPSS~\cite{wiki:spss}, SAS~\cite{wiki:sas}, and
JMP~\cite{wiki:jmp}), programming languages (e.g., R~\cite{wiki:r-language}),
and libraries (including numpy~\cite{oliphant2006numpy}, scipy~\cite{scipy}, and
statsmodels~\cite{statsmodelsPaper}), enable people to perform specific
statistical tests, but they do not address the fundamental problem that users
may not know which statistical test to perform and how to verify that specific
assumptions about their data hold. 

To address this overlooked need, we designed Tea\footnote{named after Fisher's
``Lady Tasting Tea'' experiment~\cite{fisher1937design}}, a high-level
declarative language for automating statistical test selection and execution
that abstracts the details of statistical analysis from the users. Tea captures
users' hypotheses and domain knowledge (\higherLevel, \connectConceptualStats),
reformulates these into a constraint satisfaction problem, identifies all valid
statistical tests to evaluate a hypothesis, and executes the tests.

Why constraints? are they really necessary?

\section{Discussion: Key tensions}
- inflated alpha
- inherent tension in executing multiple statistical tests vs. sensitivity

\section{Limitations, Ongoing work, Future directions}

\subsection{Ongoing development}
With teams of undergrads, I have continued to improve Tea in two specific ways. 

First, recent development has focused on updating the outputs of Tea to include
(i) interactive visualizations and (ii) text for reporting the statistical
results in the American Psychological Association's recommended formats for each
valid statistical test. The interactive visualizations aim to illustrate what
the results of the statistical tests mean, such as scatterplots for correlations
and heatmaps for the Chi-squared test. We selected the visualizations for each
test based on recommendations from Franconeri et
al.~\cite{franconeriVisualizationChooser}, what existing tools such as
JMP~\cite{jmp} already use, and our own experiences using and trying to
communicate statistical results. Development and initial user testing is on
track to wrap up by the end of spring quarter. 

Second, a usability issue with Tea's current API is its reliance of ``magic
strings.'' We are currently refactoring the API to be more object-oriented by
extending Tisane's variables data classes. We hope this revision will be more
usable with ``free'' help from existing IDEs such as VSCode that provide API
suggestions inline when specifying parameters. 

Both features will be incorporated into a new release of Tea, which I have
currently scheduled for June, 2022.
