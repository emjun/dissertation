This chapter covers material from a single project.  There are typically 3-4 of these chapters total (but any number is fine as long as your advisor is on board).


\section{Updating things if you've copied and pasted}
If you are copying and pasting material from one of your papers, then remember to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Remove the abstract and instead add a little overview of the chapter and how it ties in to the rest of the thesis. You should also mention the original paper's source like: ``This chapter includes materials originally published in $\backslash$citet\{myownppr\}''
    \item Make sure the formatting still works -- this is single column now!
    \item Consider rephrasing conference-paper-style language:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Find every place you mention some variation of ``in this paper'' and say ``in this chapter'' instead.
        \item Remove or rephrase the parts where you talk about ``our main contributions''.
        \item Rephrase the language describing code and data releases.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Replace the conclusion section with a summary section. Again, you should tie this chapter back to the main themes of the thesis.
\end{itemize}
