If you are copying and pasting material from one of your papers, then remember to:
\begin{itemize}
    % \item Remove the abstract and instead add a little overview of the chapter and how it ties in to the rest of the thesis. You should also mention the original paper's source like: ``This chapter includes materials originally published in $\backslash$citet\{myownppr\}''
    % \item Make sure the formatting still works -- this is single column now!
    \item Consider rephrasing conference-paper-style language:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Find every place you mention some variation of ``in this paper'' and say ``in this chapter'' instead.
        \item Remove or rephrase the parts where you talk about ``our main contributions''.
        \item Rephrase the language describing code and data releases.
    \end{itemize}
    % \item Replace the conclusion section with a summary section. Again, you should tie this chapter back to the main themes of the thesis.
\end{itemize}

\section{Limitations, Ongoing work, Future directions}

\subsection{Ongoing development}
With teams of undergrads, I have continued to improve Tea in two specific ways. 

First, recent development has focused on updating the outputs of Tea to include
(i) interactive visualizations and (ii) text for reporting the statistical
results in the American Psychological Association's recommended formats for each
valid statistical test. The interactive visualizations aim to illustrate what
the results of the statistical tests mean, such as scatterplots for correlations
and heatmaps for the Chi-squared test. We selected the visualizations for each
test based on recommendations from Franconeri et
al.~\cite{franconeriVisualizationChooser}, what existing tools such as
JMP~\cite{jmp} already use, and our own experiences using and trying to
communicate statistical results. Development and initial user testing is on
track to wrap up by the end of spring quarter. 

Second, a usability issue with Tea's current API is its reliance of ``magic
strings.'' We are currently refactoring the API to be more object-oriented by
extending Tisane's variables data classes. We hope this revision will be more
usable with ``free'' help from existing IDEs such as VSCode that provide API
suggestions inline when specifying parameters. 

Both features will be incorporated into a new release of Tea, which I have
currently scheduled for June, 2022. 

\section{Summary of Contributions}
% Replace the conclusion section with a summary section. Again, you should tie this chapter back to the main themes of the thesis.

1. Restate problem 
2. Articulate core contributions: problem/idea + technical
3. Key Evaluation results
4. 1 soundbite/takeaway
5. Transition to next chapter.
